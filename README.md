## 🎯 What is Nasaka IEBC?

Nasaka IEBC is a civic technology platform that bridges the gap between Kenyan citizens and electoral services. It's an interactive, community-powered map that helps you locate and verify official IEBC registration and constituency offices across Kenya—using live location tracking, turn-by-turn navigation, and crowdsourced verification.

**The Problem:** Kenyans struggle to find IEBC offices. Published lists are static, outdated, and hard to navigate. Office details change without notice. There's no transparent system for citizens to confirm or update information.

**Our Solution:** A living, verifiable directory of IEBC offices powered by official data + community verification.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🗺️ Interactive Mapping
- **Leaflet-powered map** displaying all IEBC offices across Kenya
- Visual, zoomable interface—find offices by region, constituency, or proximity
- Clean, intuitive design optimized for mobile and desktop

### 📍 Live Location Detection
- Automatically detects your current position
- Instantly surfaces the nearest verified IEBC offices
- No manual searching—the map does the work for you

### 🧭 Point-to-Point Navigation
- One-click routing from your location to any office
- Opens directly in your preferred maps app (Google Maps, Apple Maps, etc.)
- Get precise, turn-by-turn directions every time

### ✅ Community Verification System
This is what makes Nasaka IEBC unique—**you're not just a user, you're a contributor**:

- **Confirm** office details are accurate
- **Suggest** new office locations not yet on the map
- **Update** information like addresses, phone numbers, operating hours
- **Add Evidence** through notes or photos to support your contributions
- **Track History** with transparent edit logs showing data provenance

### 🔍 Transparent Data Sourcing
Every office entry shows:
- **"Listed by IEBC"** — Official government data
- **"User-Verified"** — Community-confirmed accuracy
- **Edit history** — Full transparency on who verified what and when

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Visit the map** at [recall254.vercel.app/iebc-office](https://recall254.vercel.app/iebc-office)
2. **Allow location access** (optional but recommended)
3. **Browse or search** for IEBC offices near you
4. **Click any office** to view details and get directions
5. **Verify the data** by confirming, editing, or suggesting updates
6. **Help build** a trustworthy, community-owned electoral resource

## 🏛️ Why This Matters

### Civic Transparency
Electoral access begins with knowing where to go. Nasaka IEBC democratizes that knowledge by making IEBC office data open, verifiable, and accessible to all Kenyans.

### Participatory Engagement
You're not a passive consumer—you're an active stakeholder. Every verification, edit, or suggestion strengthens Kenya's civic infrastructure.

### Open Data Foundation
We merge official IEBC office datasets with real-time crowdsourced updates, creating a single source of truth that's more accurate than any static list.

### Electoral Empowerment
Whether you're registering to vote, checking your polling station, or accessing IEBC services, Nasaka IEBC removes barriers and builds trust in the process.
