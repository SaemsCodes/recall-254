Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including, without limitation, the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions.

2. Conditions
   a. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software, including any redistributed source code and any binary or packaged form where the Software is included.
   b. If redistribution occurs in a manner where including the notices verbatim is impracticable, reasonable efforts must be made to provide recipients with a clear and accessible reference to this License and the original copyright and permission notice.
   c. Nothing in this License requires the distribution of source code alongside binaries; however, recipients of binaries must still receive or be clearly informed where to obtain the original source code and this License text.

5. Patents and Patent Rights (Non-normative clarification)

   b. Contributors are encouraged to state explicit patent grants where applicable, but absence of such a statement means patent rights remain subject to separate patent law and licensing.
